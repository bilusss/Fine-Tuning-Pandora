### Instruction:
Analyze text and predict Big Five (0-100).

### Input:
Like I said above, this is mostly a more modern view, especially in the west, but some mahayana traditions apparently see things this way as well I just found out recently.you can't, only with you own experience on the path, through deep levels of concentration and insight. The Scientific method has a very hard time talking about the mind and consciousness, let alone other existences.I don't think so, a famous Astrophysicist said " I don't think the universe is just stranger then we imagine, I think it's stranger then we CAN imagine". If you look at astrophysics, quantum physics, Multivese theory and all that... the possibilities that are born out by the math are imo much stranger then various states of existence,that we can't happen to see(nor can we see most of the wave lengths of light). The far majority of the universe is made up of something we don't even know what it is, so it's called Dark Matter, not to mention "dark" energy. Frankly I don't see it as such a stretch, considering multiverse, various dimensions etc, for there to be various beings and various ways to exist. Not only that but the Buddha also spoke of world-systems, ie galaxies of worlds with various beings etc.So this is why I keep an open mind, I've always been open minded and agnostic, and it's always served me well. I've never gotten to caught up on these things, although I am well aware that rebirth and kamma are major hang-ups for many westerners.

### Instruction:
Analyze text and predict Big Five (0-100).

### Input:
Anytime the news media really focuses in on one particular place, I always wonder what the agenda is.Reason? Because if you really understand much of global politics and humanity, you realize that there are dozens of Aleppos going on at any one time on the planet right now, most likely many more.There are probably around that many genocides going on as well. you can even see them on -http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/genocidespoliticides.html (I counted well over 30+ *present* genocides world wide from this website.)Where is all the reporting on all of these other places? Why are we "involved" here but not in these other places? how does your heart feel about them? i'm sure now that you know your heart has gotten a bit more encompassing. In situations like this it helps to see the larger picture, and not be caught up in the millions of details.and thats the point actually, getting lost in the suffering of others, (most especially when it is part of the nature of human beings, all of us having greed, hatred, and delusion), does not help you, or anyone else. You cannot stop the suffering of the world, because it has been this way before you and will be this way long after your bones are dust. What you CAN do is work on yourself, and while doing that, help others along the way. You cannot change the world, but in changing yourself you can help make the world a better place for those around you in your daily life. IMO this is a much more valid, realistic, and helpful approach then to follow emotions every time there is a sad news report and wanting to know "what do I do?" then a year later you totally forgot about that and are following some other emotions from some other place the news media wants you to see.. like a chicken running about with it's head off.So in short, continue your practice, if you have one, continue to live by virtuous principles, if you already do, and then practice giving and generosity, helping others. These three things are the core of Buddhist practice.

### Instruction:

### Input:
This is actually a very common misconception, that monks get to ordain and then sit around meditating all day, and for 99% of all the monks in the world, that is more of a fairytale then reality :).Practices vary widely depending on type of Buddhism and tradition, but monks have a busy schedule of maintaining the grounds, cleaning, study, practice, and in some traditions ministering to the various needs of the laity. Monasteries have schedules to follow and communal activities to attend.the way my schedule works is that pretty much the only time during the day that is "my own", is from 12pm after lunch and dish washing, till 6:30 for final meditation and chanting. From what I am told this breakdown of the day is pretty common among many traditions. In those six hours I try to get in all the things I need to do that aren't on the schedule, like study, memorization, learning languages, some yoga, couple miles of walking/hiking for exercise and some mid day meditation.

### Instruction:
Analyze text and predict Big Five (0-100).

### Input:
I've seen some of your other posts, saying stuff like 'Regard all phenomena as dreams'.Frankly if you actually DID see it as such, you wouldn't have to wonder why others don't see it that way, because you'd have a very deep understanding the true nature of the mind.The Bottom line is that the far majority of Buddhists on this planet, including monastics, do not meditate and are no where close to "seeing all phenomenon as dreams", so they will take offense to these things just like a Muslim who sees an image of Muhammad or a Christian who sees some mockery of Jesus. People have views(i'm this religion, I'm this political party, I'm this, I'm that) , and those views rule their action, until they have reached a point in spiritual practice where they are able to let go. Until then they are human beings like any other.

actually... you can't transfer kamma, as that is our own, but you can do deeds that might effect relatives in the afterlife, but only if they are a peta, or ghost, according to one sutta, I believe its the ONLY sutta in the entirety of the nikayas that covers this topic that has become a norm in Buddhism today: http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.177.than.htmlThis was a practice originally done by the Brahmins, that continues to be done in Buddhism to this day

I can understand as a collector you want to keep one in the box and then get one for yourself, I don't find that greedy at all but the people who take one away from those that want it disgust me. The most genuine reaction that I saw to this was a woman who happened to come in five minutes after my store opened and found out we had one left. She literally jumped with joy and could barely get her debit card in the sig pad because she was so happy that she could get this for her husband for Christmas. She deserved it more than anyone on that line whom couldn't have cared less about buying it.

### Input:
I had a terrible tendency to give advice to people by circumventing the conversation back to me and my experiences as if I was the only person that went through them. I remember a friend just candidly approaching me and saying that I gave great advice, but all I would do was talk about myself and not involve the other person's experiences to to the conversation. It had to do with me actually listening to people are learning to keep my mouth shut when people would talk to me. Now I sit and listen, give the best advice I can using their experiences mixed with mine and allow people to be involved in the conversation. It makes for a better guide to the other person since they know I'm listening and also helping them out with whatever was bothering them.

My perception of Joe is that he is interested in a ton of topics that go on right now and he will go on youtube and watch a few videos to sort of get a simple grasp of it. He knows he has the pull to get some of these guys on to explain to him in their words what is going on and he (as well as us) are fortunate enough to be a part of. He's just a guy trying to figure out a bunch of topics, especially ones that he is interested in more than others. I don't mind the SJW conversation because the more I hear about it the more I can hone my opinion of it and a better grasp I have of it.

### Input:
The most hard-wearing t-shirt I have ever had the pleasure to know was made of hemp jersey (possibly a hemp/ cotton blend). I bought it for one of my boys, it got worn and washed a lot, and then it went through two of my sister's boys, and then it got passed on to another family. Hemp is extremely durable and dries quickly. It doesn't take dye as well as cotton, so the colours tend to be somewhat muted. Another point in its favour is that it is more UV resistant, so it will protect you better from the sun, and will stand up to line drying in full sun better than most other fabrics.

They're pretty excited...but they are both like "lol why were you freaking out in the first place, we knew you'd get in..." Granted, they're biased parents. And college has changed since my dad went to med school and my mom went to law school. But they're both overly confident haha. No crying...but I think that's because it doesn't feel real? It still feels like just yesterday my fifth grade teacher was asking where we'd all like to go to college someday. I find out from Case Western and Tulane in the next few days too. Everything feels unreal.

### Instruction:

### Input:
I thought I was gay for like three years of my high school life. At the time, I didn’t know it was possible to like both genders and I remembered being confused at what the hell ‘bisexual’ is. I just automatically labeled myself as a lesbian when I found out about my attraction to girls. Anyway I was just casually sitting down one day, when suddenly a light bulb turned on in my head and I was like “now, wait just a minute..”Honestly, I still cannot believe how I didn’t realize it sooner. I’d daydreamed about my male classmate in seventh grade, developed a strange fascination with this actor on tv when he grew a beard, hell I even created a damn facebook fan page for Lee Hong-gi. ��
