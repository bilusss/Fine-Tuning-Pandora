    "text": "Like I said above, this is mostly a more modern view, especially in the west, but some mahayana traditions apparently see things this way as well I just found out recently.you can't, only with you own experience on the path, through deep levels of concentration and insight. The Scientific method has a very hard time talking about the mind and consciousness, let alone other existences.I don't think so, a famous Astrophysicist said \" I don't think the universe is just stranger then we imagine, I think it's stranger then we CAN imagine\". If you look at astrophysics, quantum physics, Multivese theory and all that... the possibilities that are born out by the math are imo much stranger then various states of existence,that we can't happen to see(nor can we see most of the wave lengths of light). The far majority of the universe is made up of something we don't even know what it is, so it's called Dark Matter, not to mention \"dark\" energy. Frankly I don't see it as such a stretch, considering multiverse, various dimensions etc, for there to be various beings and various ways to exist. Not only that but the Buddha also spoke of world-systems, ie galaxies of worlds with various beings etc.So this is why I keep an open mind, I've always been open minded and agnostic, and it's always served me well. I've never gotten to caught up on these things, although I am well aware that rebirth and kamma are major hang-ups for many westerners. ",

    "text": "Anytime the news media really focuses in on one particular place, I always wonder what the agenda is.Reason? Because if you really understand much of global politics and humanity, you realize that there are dozens of Aleppos going on at any one time on the planet right now, most likely many more.There are probably around that many genocides going on as well. you can even see them on -http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/genocidespoliticides.html (I counted well over 30+ *present* genocides world wide from this website.)Where is all the reporting on all of these other places? Why are we \"involved\" here but not in these other places? how does your heart feel about them? i'm sure now that you know your heart has gotten a bit more encompassing. In situations like this it helps to see the larger picture, and not be caught up in the millions of details.and thats the point actually, getting lost in the suffering of others, (most especially when it is part of the nature of human beings, all of us having greed, hatred, and delusion), does not help you, or anyone else. You cannot stop the suffering of the world, because it has been this way before you and will be this way long after your bones are dust. What you CAN do is work on yourself, and while doing that, help others along the way. You cannot change the world, but in changing yourself you can help make the world a better place for those around you in your daily life. IMO this is a much more valid, realistic, and helpful approach then to follow emotions every time there is a sad news report and wanting to know \"what do I do?\" then a year later you totally forgot about that and are following some other emotions from some other place the news media wants you to see.. like a chicken running about with it's head off.So in short, continue your practice, if you have one, continue to live by virtuous principles, if you already do, and then practice giving and generosity, helping others. These three things are the core of Buddhist practice.",

    "text": "This is actually a very common misconception, that monks get to ordain and then sit around meditating all day, and for 99% of all the monks in the world, that is more of a fairytale then reality :).Practices vary widely depending on type of Buddhism and tradition, but monks have a busy schedule of maintaining the grounds, cleaning, study, practice, and in some traditions ministering to the various needs of the laity. Monasteries have schedules to follow and communal activities to attend.the way my schedule works is that pretty much the only time during the day that is \"my own\", is from 12pm after lunch and dish washing, till 6:30 for final meditation and chanting. From what I am told this breakdown of the day is pretty common among many traditions. In those six hours I try to get in all the things I need to do that aren't on the schedule, like study, memorization, learning languages, some yoga, couple miles of walking/hiking for exercise and some mid day meditation.

People have views(i'm this religion, I'm this political party, I'm this, I'm that) , and those views rule their action, until they have reached a point in spiritual practice where they are able to let go. Until then they are human beings like any other. ",

It still feels like just yesterday my fifth grade teacher was asking where we'd all like to go to college someday. I find out from Case Western and Tulane in the next few days too.

Anyway I was just casually sitting down one day, when suddenly a light bulb turned on in my head and I was like “now, wait just a minute..”Honestly, I still cannot believe how I didn’t realize it sooner. I’d daydreamed about my male classmate in seventh grade, developed a strange fascination with this actor on tv when he grew a beard, hell I even created a damn facebook fan page for Lee Hong-gi. ��",
